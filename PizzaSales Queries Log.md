### Breaking things down by Country

**1.**  What is the liklihood of dying if you contract covid (in India)?

````sql
SELECT LOCATION,DATE,TOTAL_CASES,
	TOTAL_DEATHS,
	(TOTAL_DEATHS * 1.0 / TOTAL_CASES * 1.0) * 100 AS DEATH_PERCENTAGE
FROM COVID_DEATHS
WHERE LOCATION = 'India'
	AND CONTINENT IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2 DESC
````
