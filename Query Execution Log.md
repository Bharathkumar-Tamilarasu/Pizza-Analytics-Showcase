### A.	KPIâ€™s

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

#### I.	Total Revenue

````

**Results:**

| total_revenue |
|---------------|
| 817860.0508   |

#### II. Average Order Value

The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.

````sql
SELECT SUM(TOTAL_PRICE) / COUNT(DISTINCT ORDER_ID) AS AVERAGE_ORDER_VALUE
FROM PIZZA_SALES
````

**Results:**

| average_order_value |
|---------------------|
| 38.30726233         |

#### III. Total Pizzas Sold

The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.

````sql

#### V.	Average Pizzas Per Order

The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

````sql
